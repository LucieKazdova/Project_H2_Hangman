# Hangman — Word Guessing Game 🎯

A classic command-line word guessing game written in Python.
Guess the hidden word letter by letter — but be careful, you only have 8 attempts!


##  Features

### Example Game Rules

You guess one lowercase letter at a time
If the letter is in the word → it appears in the correct position(s)
If not → you lose one attempt
